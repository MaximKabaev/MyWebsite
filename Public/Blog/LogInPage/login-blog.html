        Common iOS Wi-Fi Log in issues

                Whether public Wi-Fi is free or not, iPhones may display a pop-up authorization window. In this guide, I will show you how to fix some of the most common problems with these pop-up windows.
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The pop-up window needs to be exited to complete the authentication, but Wi-Fi disconnects on exit.
                    <div>
                        This might happen due to a bad log in design. 
                        For example, to connect to the Wi-Fi, the user needs to call a phone number, which makes the pop-up window close. 
                        Also, simply opening the log-in window in Safari will not work because the Wi-Fi gets disconnected when the pop-up window is closed.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        First, tap the "i" next to the Wi-Fi network you are aiming to connect to. Tap "Configure Proxy". 
                        Choose "Manual". After that, put "127.0.0.1"into the "Server" and "80" into the port. Press "Save".
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        Try to connect to the network again after following these steps. 
                        Tap the "i" again. Look at the "Router" IP address under "IPV4 ADDRESS" and copy it by holding it. 
                        Now go to Safari and put that IP address you just copied in the search bar. 
                        The authentication window should appear and will not go away now. Complete the authentication and come back to the settings. 
                        Now, tap the "i" once again next to the Wi-Fi network you are trying to connect to. Go to "Configure Proxy" and set it to "Off". Now, connect to the Wi-Fi as you normally would, and everything should work fine now.
                    </div>
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    It appears that Wi-Fi is connected, but the pop-up window doesn't appear.
                    <div>
                        Go to Safari and type in "apple.com" or "google.com". The Wi-Fi log-in window will appear when Safari attempts to open the website.
                    </div>
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    Wi-Fi is connected and a pop-up window shows up, but the window has to be exited to complete the authentication.
                    <div>
                        Try to follow the second problem (input "apple.com" or "google.com" into Safari).
                    </div>
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    "No Internet connection" error
                    <div>
                        Select the "i" next to the Wi-Fi you want to connect to. Tap the "Forget the network" button. 
                        Reconnect your Wi-Fi by clicking it again. The Wi-Fi signal might be too weak, so try moving closer to the router. There may also be a problem at the other site. For example, a cafe's Wi-Fi may be down temporarily due to some issue.
